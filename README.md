### **How to play:**
+ Select the game you want to play
+ If playing Coin Toss, choose heads or tails. The game will flip heads or tails and tell you if you were correct.
+ If playing the Guessing Game, type a number and press enter. The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.

The Coin Toss will track how many wins or losses you have:

``` js
tracking.innerHTML = `Wins = ${wins} Losses = ${losses}`;
```
